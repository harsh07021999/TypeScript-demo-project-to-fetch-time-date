# TypeScript-demo-project-to-fetch-time-date
This is demonstraition project for me to learn to use typescript for first time.

To start project clone it and open a command line in the project directory
Then run npm install
All the webpack configuration is alredy done
You just have to open the index.html in the browser and you are done.
